Compilation instructions:

1- Run a bash shell and 'cd' to code directory
2- execute: export MATLABROOT="PATH TO bin/glnx64" matlab folder (without the trailing '/')
3- ./waf configure
4- ./waf build
5- ./waf --run lena-simple

if everything works fine a matlab logo would indicate matlab correctly run from within ns-3 according to scratch/lena-simple.cc scenario.
